                            In this mode, you'll be playing without any time restrictions. Your main goal is to guess as
                            many words as possible until it's game over. You can compete with your own High Score. Can
                            you guess em all ?

                            Pretty much the same thing as survival but with a time limit for each word. You think it's
                            easy ?
                            What if I told you that the time limit will eventually keep reducing as your streak reaches
                            a certain threshold ?
                            Still up for challenge ?

                            Feeling a bit lonely playing by yourself ?
                            Ask a friend to tag along to see who's the best at this game.
                            In this mode, you can play between 2-6 players, and compete to see who scores
                            the highest within the max number of chosen turns.
